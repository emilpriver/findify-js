# General instructions

### Setting Up a Local Copy

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/findify/findify-js`
3. Run `yarn` in the root `findify-js` folder.

Once it is done, you can start working on the project.

### TDD

First, run `npm run build:tdd`, it will watch and rebuild packages for test env.
Wait until its finished and then run `npm t` in parallel that will watch and run tests.

## Workflow

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work. This is usually `develop`.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Write good commit messages (see below).
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request
- If its not a hotfix or something urgent wait for at least one approval from
  the [codeowners](https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/)

Tag all merged pull requests that go into the release with the relevant milestone.
Each merged PR should also be labeled with one of the labels named
`tag: ...`  to indicate what kind of change it is.
List of tags in lerna.json should match thouse on GitHub.

When creating a pull request, its comment should reference the corresponding issue id.

We use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) +
[cz-lerna-changelog](https://github.com/atlassian/cz-lerna-changelog) to format commit messages and
[lerna-semantic-release](https://github.com/atlassian/lerna-semantic-release) to release new versions automatically.

Use `make commit` `npm run c` instead of `git commit`.
Read: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Use package name to specify the `scope` of change.
You can use `*` when the change affects more than a single scope and `^` if its
a top-level change or a "chore" related to the monorepo setup.

* Commits of type `fix` will trigger bugfix releases, think `0.0.1`
* Commits of type `feat` will trigger feature releases, think `0.1.0`
* Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE` in body or footer will trigger breaking releases, think `1.0.0`

All other commit types will trigger no new release.

Commits that have [ci skip] or [skip ci] anywhere in the commit messages are ignored by Travis CI.

### Git branch naming conventions:

* master
* develop
* feature/something
* bugfix/something
* hotfix/something
* chore/something
* refactoring/something
